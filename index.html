    <h4><b>Definiton of Defensive Design</b></h4>
    <p>Defensive Design is meant to deter 'undesirable' parties from using particular public spaces, or to prevent people from using public spaces in unintended ways.</p>
    <p>Such undesirable parties can include the animals with which we share this planet, and our  unhomed neighbors.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it has the side effect of designing against the disabled, the elderly, and children - arguably some of the most vulnerable populations amongst us.</p>
    <p>Defensive Design can take many forms. A lack of infrastructure also speaks to a government that has largely forsaken their most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women or anyone with small children, and the unhomed.</p>
