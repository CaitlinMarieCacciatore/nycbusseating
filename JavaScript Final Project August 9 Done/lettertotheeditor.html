    <h1>Letter to the Editor</h1>

    <p>To the Editors at The New York Times,</p>

<p>I have recently become incredibly concerned about the MTA's campaign to replace traditional benches with leaning bars across the five boroughs of New York City.</p>

<p>These leaning bars prevent an accessibility barrier to many of those who rely upon the transit system.</p>

<p>Pregnant women and people with disabilities &ndash; both visible and invisible &ndash; as well as the elderly and young children, all of whom are arguably amongst the most vulnerable populations in society, seem to suffer disproportionately from the replacement of traditional seating areas with new, sleek leaning bars that do not allow people to truly rest while waiting for the bus or the train.</p>

<p>I live in New York City, and I consider myself an ally of historically marginalized groups and other vulnerable populations. While it has not been explicitly stated by the MTA, a large part of the reason for the replacement is part of an aggressive campaign to make our urban spaces less hospitable for our unhomed neighbors.</p>

<p>Leaning bars may seem like a mere inconvenience to some. To others, they pose an insurmountable barrier to navigating a failing transit system. The MTA often spends time, manpower, and money on such &lsquo;upgrades&rsquo; and &lsquo;modernizations&rsquo; while ignoring the real and pressing needs of those who ride with them.</p>

<p>I would like to call for a reinstatement of benches. Leaning bars can be an excellent supplement to traditional seating arrangements, but they should not be allowed to replace benches entirely. This is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>It is ultimately an issue of universal access. It&rsquo;s about allowing the greatest number of people who wish to use the transit system to be successful in doing so while maintaining a basic level of human dignity. A pregnant woman should not be asked to stand out in the humid August heat, with only a leaning bar for support. Very young children and persons of short stature might not be able to use the leaning bar at all. Those with visible disabilities and/or people who use a cane or a walker, might not be physically able to stand for the time it takes for the bus or train to arrive, and people who experience invisible disabilities might find their symptoms aggravated by a lack of proper seating.</p>

<p>As such, it is only logical that benches be replaced where they were removed, and added to more bus stops and train stations, especially in areas where there is a dearth of seating arrangements.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration,</p>

<p>Caitlin Cacciatore</p>
